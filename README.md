# Research Proposal

Professor LaBelle and his group has launched a rocket in 2019 into the daytime aurora borealis. With the assistance of a wave receiver, variations in the electric field at a range of low and high frequencies were detected. Through the set of power and frequency data obtained, spectrograms could be created, as portrayed by the one below:

We see here that there is a cutoff delimited by the spectrum of the waves. These cutoffs denote the plasma frequency, which is the fundamental resonant frequency in a charged particle gas. This is important because once the plasma frequency can be attained, the density as a function of time of the charged particles can be also calculated. Moreover, it was detected through those spectrograms that strong waves are present even at very low frequencies. Those waves are electric field waves, and theory suggests that they are directly intertwined with charge density variations, something known as the Boltzmann relation. Therefore, with the density and the electric field variations at hand, we can test this theoretical relationship.
As such, the entire process begins with finding the largest downward transition in a plot (power vs frequency) for a specific timestamp. As illustrated in the figure below:
